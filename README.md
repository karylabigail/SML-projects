# Fetal Health Prediction with CTG Data
## Introduction
This project aims to predict fetal health outcomes based on Cardiotocography (CTG) data. CTG exams provide valuable insights into fetal well-being, and our machine learning models strive to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Whether itâ€™s identifying normal cases or detecting pathological conditions, this project bridges data science and healthcare.
## Features
- CTG Data Exploration: Dive into the CTG dataset, understanding its attributes and patterns.
- Model Building: Employ supervised machine learning techniques (including Decision Trees and SVM) to predict fetal health outcomes.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and Fbeta-score.
- Interpretability: Investigate feature importance and decision boundaries to enhance clinical understanding.
